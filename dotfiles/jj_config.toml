# retrunk:
# `jj rebase -d 'trunk()'` is shorthand for `jj rebase -b @ -d 'trunk()'`
#
# What that does:
#
# `-b @` rebases the entire branch that the current @ is on relative to the destination. (Default),
# `-d trunk()` sets the destination. trunk() finds the most recent `main | master | trunk` branch that's on a remote.
# trunk() is builtin.
